# Word Recognition on a Digital Signal Processor
recognizing speech commands even while video is playing

- isolated word recognition
- adaptive noise cancellation (voice from TV does not influence recognition)
- algorithm designed in MATLAB
- implemented in C language on Analog Devices BF548 digital signal processor
- execution efficiency optimization & memory management permit real-time processing
