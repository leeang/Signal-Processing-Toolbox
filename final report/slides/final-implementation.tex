\section{Final Implementation}

\frametitle{Improvements on previous work}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Coefficients that intensively require floating-point computations are precomputed. (Hamming window and discrete cosine transform)
\item Frame energy is calculated in fixed-point arithmetic.
\item Mel-bank filter gains are precomputed and stored in an ingeniously designed structure. Meaningless multiplications with zeros are illuminated.
\item Symmetry is sufficiently taken in to consideration. (FFT of real sequence and discrete cosine transform)
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Performance on DSP Board}
We randomly test the final system on DSP for 23 times and compare the outcomes computed by DSP and MATLAB.
\begin{itemize}
	\item dataset $n$ ($n = 1, 2, \dots, 23$) and word $k$ ($k = 1, 2, \dots, 27$)
	\item $p_{MATLAB}[n, k]$ denotes the probability (natural-log scale) computed by MATLAB
	\item $p_{DSP}[n, k]$ denotes the probability (natural-log scale) computed by DSP
\end{itemize}

The \textit{relative error} of word $k$ in dataset $n$
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon[n, k] = \frac{p_{DSP}[n, k] - p_{MATLAB}[n, k]}{p_{MATLAB}[n, k]}
\end{equation}
The \textit{Root Mean Square Error} of dataset $n$
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{RMSE}[n] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{27} \sum_{k = 1}^{27} (\varepsilon[n, k])^2}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}
