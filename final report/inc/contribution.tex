Minjia \textsc{Zheng} conducted theoretical research in Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and realized MFCC in MATLAB. She also researched Hidden Markov Model theory and trained speech model in MATLAB. Beside, she continuously refined the training method. Eventually, words can be effective recognized in MATLAB. She wrote Feature extraction 1, HMM, Training...\\

Ang \textsc{Li} rewrote the MFCC precess in MATLAB base on Minjia's code in order to optimize algorithm efficiency. Subsequently, he implemented word recognition algorithms on DSP for real-time processing. As a result, all computations finishes in 200 ms and probabilities of words calculated by DSP are consistent with Minjia's MATLAB code. He is also in charge of control of YouTube and communications between DSP and PC. He wrote Feature extraction 2, DSP...\\

Yuanyuan \textsc{Sun} did research in Least Mean Square algorithm and combined theory with the utilization scenario of our project. She designed LMS algorithm in MATLAB and implemented it on DSP. Due to the resource limitation of the DSP board, efficiency-oriented optimizations are conducted to satisfy real-time processing specification. She wrote LMS...
